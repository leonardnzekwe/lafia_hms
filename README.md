It is aimed at solving most of the limitations attached to the traditional record-keeping system in Hospitals. As a pharmacologist, Rahmat have seen several limitations firsthand on how patients can lose their lives due to delays in doctor's appointments and care, data loss due to environmental hazards, and data mismatch. Also, Leonard and Ifeanyi has experienced the stress of standing in long queues in hospitals waiting to be attended to. So we decided to solve these limitations through Lafia HMS.

# Contributing Team
The Lafia HMS was built as team by:

- [Rahmat Folorunsho](https://github.com/rahma-cloud)
- [Ifeanyi Akamigbo](https://github.com/valentine1244)
- [Leonard Nzekwe](https://github.com/leonardnzekwe)

# Technology
We strived to follow the industry best standards. So we seperated our backend logic from our front end logic. We exposed the data via API endpoints, which is consumed by the frontend through making a http request to the endpoints.

- Backend (API):
- - Language: Python
- - API Framework: Django, Django Rest Framework
- Frontend (UI):
- - Language: Typescript
- - Web Framework: Nextjs
- - Styling Framework: Tailwind CSS
- UI/UX (Design):
- - Tool: Figma
- Hosting Platforms:
- - Frontend & Backend - Vercel
- - Database - Vercel Postgres
- - Codebase - Github
